Energy Usage Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze energy usage data using Jupyter Notebook with pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. The analysis includes exploring the dataset, visualizing energy consumption trends, and deriving insights from the data.

Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.x
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a CSV file named Energy.csv. It contains information about energy consumption over time, which will be used to perform various analyses and visualizations.

Setup
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Running the Code
Open Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the project directory and open the Energy_Usage_Analysis.ipynb file.
Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
Modify the code or visualizations as needed for your analysis.
Files in the Repository
Energy.csv: CSV file containing the energy usage data.
Energy_Usage_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with the analysis code and visualizations.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
